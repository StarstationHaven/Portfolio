                <h3>A Little More About Me</h3>

          <p>Technology has been my passion from a young age. When I wasn't playing video games, I was working on graphic designs and managing websites. I loved technology because of its potential. I saw technology as a tool to make life easier and more efficient.</p>
          
          <p>A focus on tech led to interest in all things related: games, anime, and music. Although these passions were considered hobbies to some, they were powerful forces of motivation for me. The morals I assimilated through games, the characters I connected to in anime, and heartfelt inspirations from music propelled me forward in life. I used my passion as a inner flame of motivaiton, to accomplish change in the world. </p>
          
          <p>As I progressed, I discovered that I enjoyed working with others. My pursuits were focused on bringing about innovative change to communities, students, and businesses. With this in mind, I executed large-scale conventions, instructional designs, curriculum, leadership initiatives, mentorship programs, and project management.</p>
          
          <p>Each initiative was impacted by my interests, and  I maintained an adaptable approach that allowed me to adapt to any project, any context, and any person. My work ethic is to do what is best for the situation and people involved, I approach work with a mindset of empathy; to address the needs of others regardless of my personal opinion.</p>
          
           <p>Overall, my goal was to leave a lasting, positive impact on the world. My drive combined with  wide expertise allows me to bring about meaningful change in various areas of work.</p>
